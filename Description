Python EDA Repository

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects written in Python by. 

The goal of these projects is to showcase Python skills and demonstrate the ability to analyze data and draw meaningful insights from it.

Each project consists of a Jupyter notebook that contains code and Markdown cells explaining the data analysis process, visualizations, and conclusions. 

The datasets used in these projects are publicly available and provide a range of interesting challenges for the analyst to tackle.

The projects in this repository serve as a great starting point for anyone looking to learn more about data analysis in Python or gain a deeper understanding of how to approach EDA projects. 

They are designed to be accessible to both beginner and experienced Python users, and include clear explanations to help illustrate the concepts.

If you are interested in exploring the world of data analysis in Python, this repository is a great place to start!
